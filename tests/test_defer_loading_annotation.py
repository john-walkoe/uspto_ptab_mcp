"""The `defer_loading` tool annotation must reach the wire.

Three tools are eager (`PTAB_search_trials_minimal`, `PTAB_get_guidance`,
`PTAB_get_documents`); the other eleven are deferred, and that split is the
server's context saving. `defer_loading` is not an MCP spec field, and MCP SDK
2.x sieves non-spec fields out of spec-method results per protocol version —
see `fastmcp_compat` for the mechanism. Without that shim every tool arrives
eagerly loaded, with no error and no log line.

These tests assert against `serialize_server_result`, the SDK call that
actually shapes the tools/list response, rather than against `to_mcp_tool()`:
an incomplete shim passes the latter and still strips the wire.
