"""Rotate INTERNAL_AUTH_SECRET with a two-step overlap window (S-06, PT-14).

  uv run python scripts/rotate_internal_auth_secret.py

INTERNAL_AUTH_SECRET plays three roles across the four USPTO MCPs: the
x-api-key transport-gate credential, the HMAC root for the inter-MCP service
tokens PTAB uses to register documents with PFW's centralized proxy, and
(in HTTP mode=none) the admin credential. It has always been one value,
generated once by whichever MCP installs first and copied by the others
("first MCP wins"), with no key id and no rotation path -- rotating meant
deleting the stored file on every host and restarting all four servers in
the same instant, which in practice meant it never happened.

This generates a new root, writes "new,old" into this MCP's secure store
(the existing DPAPI / systemd-creds-backed single-key-per-file store --
it stores whatever string it is given; a comma just makes that string a
rotation list), and prints the INTERNAL_AUTH_SECRET env line every one of
the four MCPs' HTTP deployments should be updated to. Both the x-api-key
gate and the inter-MCP service-token verifier accept ANY listed candidate,
so the fleet does not need to restart in the same instant.

Two-step rotation:
  1. Run this script once (on any one of the four hosts -- they do not need
     to agree on WHERE the secret lives, only on its value). Deploy the
     printed "new,old" value to all four MCPs and roll them one at a time;
     each keeps accepting both values while the others are mid-rollout.
  2. Once every MCP is confirmed on the new deploy, set INTERNAL_AUTH_SECRET
     to just the new value (drop the old one, printed below too) and roll
     again to close the overlap window. Leaving both values in place
     indefinitely keeps the retired secret live.
