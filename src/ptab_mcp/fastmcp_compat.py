"""FastMCP 4 / MCP SDK 2 compatibility shim: keep the `defer_loading` annotation.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Every tool here is registered with a `defer_loading` annotation — the flag
Claude's tool-search reads to decide which tools load eagerly and which are
fetched on demand. Three are eager (`PTAB_search_trials_minimal`,
`PTAB_get_guidance`, `PTAB_get_documents`); the other eleven are deferred.
That split is where this server's context savings come from, and it is
advertised in SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS and pinned in CLAUDE.md.

`defer_loading` is not an MCP spec field. Under FastMCP 3 / `mcp` 1.x it rode
the wire because `ToolAnnotations` was declared `extra="allow"`, so unknown
keys round-tripped through validation and serialization untouched.

FastMCP 4 pulls `mcp` 2.x / `mcp-types` 2.x, which strip it in TWO places:

1. `mcp_types.ToolAnnotations` no longer sets `extra="allow"`, so it inherits
   pydantic's `extra="ignore"` and the key is dropped at tool construction.

2. More fundamentally, `mcp/server/runner.py::ServerRunner._serialize` now
   passes every spec-method result through
   `mcp_types.methods.serialize_server_result(method, version, dumped)`, which
   re-validates the response against a PER-PROTOCOL-VERSION surface model
   (`mcp_types._v2025_11_25`, `mcp_types._v2026_07_28`) whose own docstring
   says: "The surface model carries `extra="ignore"`, so fields not in
   `version`'s schema are dropped from the returned dict."

Point 2 is the one that matters, and it is deliberate protocol-conformance
behavior, not an oversight: the SDK now guarantees that a server cannot emit
fields outside the negotiated version's schema. Fixing only point 1 makes the
patch look applied — `to_mcp_tool()` and a direct `ListToolsResult.model_dump()`
both show the key — while the wire output is still stripped, because the sieve
runs after both.

    ==> THIS IS A DELIBERATE SDK BEHAVIOR THIS MODULE OVERRIDES. <==

This module is vendored across the USPTO MCP fleet and is deliberately
repo-agnostic apart from `_CUSTOM_ANNOTATION` and this docstring, so a fix
found in one repo is a straight copy into the others.

The alternative is to accept that `defer_loading` cannot cross an MCP SDK 2.x
server boundary, which would make every tool eagerly loaded. That is a product
decision; this module preserves the pre-migration behavior so the FastMCP 4
upgrade is not also a silent tool-search regression. Revisit it if the MCP
spec grows a real deferred-loading field, or if this stops being worth
maintaining across `mcp-types` releases.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
Restores `extra="allow"` on `ToolAnnotations` in the canonical type module and
in each per-version surface module, rebuilds the models that embed it
(bottom-up — a pydantic model's core schema snapshots its nested models'
schemas at class creation, and `model_rebuild(force=True)` only re-derives the
class it is called on), and clears the `@cache`d `TypeAdapter` the sieve uses.

Must run BEFORE any tool is registered; `main.py` imports it directly under
its `fastmcp` import for that reason.

Verified end-to-end through `serialize_server_result` itself — the actual
boundary — for every protocol version the SDK offers, and raises on failure.
A silent no-op here would turn the whole tool surface eagerly loaded with no
other symptom.
